                <h3>Commonly Encountered Network Protocols</h3>
                <p>Network protocols are the standardized rules that govern how devices communicate and exchange data across a network. 
                    Each protocol serves a specific function — from transferring files to resolving domain names — and operates using 
                    designated port numbers that help direct traffic to the correct service. Understanding these common protocols is essential 
                    for anyone working with or studying networking, as they form the backbone of digital communication.</p>
                <p>One of the most fundamental protocols is the <b><i>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</i></b>, which ensures reliable, ordered data 
                    delivery between devices. It works alongside the <b><i>Internet Protocol (IP)</i></b> — together known as TCP/IP — to route data packets across networks.</p>
                <p> Many popular services run on top of TCP. For instance, <b><i>HTTP</i></b> uses port 80 to enable web browsers and 
                    servers to exchange web pages, while its secure counterpart <b><i>HTTPS</i></b> uses port 443, encrypting traffic via SSL/TLS for privacy and security. 
                    Another widely used TCP-based service is <b><i>FTP</i></b> on ports 20 and 21, designed for uploading and downloading files between systems.
                    <b><i>SSH</i></b>, running on port 22, provides encrypted command-line access to remote systems, replacing older, 
                    insecure methods like <b><i>Telnet</i></b>. <b><i>SMTP</i></b> on port 25 handles outgoing 
                    email delivery, while <b><i>POP3</i></b> on port 110 and <b><i>IMAP</i></b> on port 143 manage incoming messages. </p>
                <p>Other protocols rely on <b><i>UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</i></b>, which trades reliability for speed. UDP is ideal for real-time 
                    applications where slight data loss is acceptable, such as <b><i>DNS</i></b> on port 53, which translates domain names 
                    (like “example.com”) into IP addresses. Similarly, <b><i>DHCP</i></b>, using ports 67 and 68, automatically 
                    assigns IP addresses to devices joining a network, simplifying network management. <b><i>SNMP</i></b> on port 
                    161 allows administrators to monitor and configure networked devices, while <b><i>TFTP</i></b> on port 69 provides a 
                    lightweight, connectionless method for transferring files, often used in network booting.</p>
