                <h3>A Comparison of Different Network Media</h3>
                <p>Physical network media form the foundation of all data communication, serving as the tangible pathways 
                    through which information travels. Over the years, a variety of media types have been developed, each 
                    with unique properties suited to different environments, speeds, and applications. Understanding these 
                    media — from copper cables to fiber optics and beyond — is key to grasping how networks function and evolve.</p>
                <p><b><i>Twisted pair cabling</i></b> is one of the most common forms of physical network media, especially in local area networks (LANs). 
                    It consists of pairs of insulated copper wires twisted together to reduce electromagnetic interference. 
                    There are two main categories: unshielded twisted pair (UTP), used widely for Ethernet connections due to 
                    its cost-effectiveness and ease of installation, and shielded twisted pair (STP), which includes an additional 
                    protective layer to prevent signal degradation in electrically noisy environments. While twisted pair cables 
                    can transmit data at impressive speeds, they are best suited for shorter distances compared to other media types.</p>
                <p><b><i>Coaxial cable</i></b>, once the backbone of early computer networks and television systems, features a single 
                    copper conductor surrounded by insulation, shielding, and an outer jacket. Its robust shielding makes it more resistant 
                    to interference than twisted pair cables, allowing for longer transmission distances and higher bandwidth. Though less 
                    common in modern LANs, coaxial cables are still used in broadband internet and certain industrial applications where 
                    reliability and signal integrity are critical.</p>
                <p><b><i>Fiber optic cable</i></b> represents the pinnacle of modern physical network media. Instead of transmitting electrical signals, 
                    it uses pulses of light to carry data through strands of glass or plastic fibers. This allows for extremely high-speed, 
                    long-distance communication with minimal signal loss and immunity to electromagnetic interference. Single-mode fiber is designed 
                    for long-distance, high-capacity links, while multi-mode fiber is used for shorter distances within buildings or campuses. As demand 
                    for faster, more reliable connections grows, fiber optics have become the preferred choice for backbone infrastructure and next-generation networks.</p>
                <p>In addition to these wired options, the rise of <b><i>wireless transmission</i></b> — while not a physical medium in the traditional sense — 
                    complements physical infrastructure by enabling mobility and flexibility. Together, these diverse media form the intricate web of 
                    connectivity that underpins everything from small home networks to vast global data systems. Each type plays a vital role in shaping 
                    the speed, reach, and reliability of the modern digital world.</p>
