                <h3>The History of Networking</h3>
                <p>The history of networking is a story of innovation born from a simple goal: connecting computers so they could share information. 
                    In the 1950s and 1960s, computers were massive, isolated machines used primarily for computation. 
                    Researchers began exploring ways to link them together, leading to the development of early experimental systems like <b><i>packet switching</i></b>, 
                    a revolutionary concept that broke data into small packets sent independently across a network and reassembled at the destination. 
                    This method proved far more efficient than traditional circuit switching and laid the groundwork for all modern digital communication.</p>
                <p>The first major milestone came in 1969 with <b><i>ARPANET</i></b>, a U.S. Department of Defense project that connected four 
                    research universities — UCLA, Stanford, UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah. Using packet switching and the pioneering 
                    <b><i>Network Control Protocol (NCP)</i></b>, ARPANET became the world’s first operational network and demonstrated that computers 
                    could reliably exchange data over long distances. By the 1970s, the <b><i>Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)</i></b> replaced NCP, 
                    creating a universal standard for communication that would eventually give rise to the global Internet.</p>
                <p>During the 1980s, networking expanded beyond government and academic circles into the commercial world. <b><i>Local Area Networks (LANs) </i></b>
                    became increasingly popular in businesses and schools, allowing users to share printers, files, and software across connected workstations. 
                    Technologies like <b><i>Ethernet</i></b>, developed at Xerox PARC, standardized LAN communication and set the stage for the high-speed 
                    wired networks we use today. Meanwhile, the <b><i>Domain Name System (DNS)</i></b> was introduced to simplify navigation across 
                    the growing network by replacing numerical IP addresses with human-readable domain names — an essential step toward the user-friendly Internet.</p>
                <p>By the early 1990s, these foundational technologies converged to create the modern <b><i>Internet</i></b>. The introduction of the <b><i>World Wide Web</i></b>, 
                    web browsers, and graphical interfaces transformed networking from a specialized technical field into a global communication platform accessible to anyone. 
                    The early networking technologies — from packet switching to Ethernet — not only connected machines but also connected people, 
                    ideas, and cultures, paving the way for the interconnected world we now take for granted.</p>
